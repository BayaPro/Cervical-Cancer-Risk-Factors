The idea of this project was to see how we can predict cervical cancer incidence based on common risk factors. 

The original dataset was downloaded from UCI repository, contained 36 variables including four response variables (
results of four diagnostic tests), which were summed into one response variable:
- if sum of values in diagnostic test columns was above 2, the result would be deemed Cancer Positive, 
- and if the sum value was below 2, the patient was Cancer Negative. 

For the purpose of this project, the risk factors taken into consideration were:
- age,
- number of sexual partners,
- number of pregnancies,
- number of years of hormonal contraception,
- number of sexually transmitted diseases,
- previous cancer diagnosis,
- HPV (human papilommavirus),
- Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,

The result of random forest algorithm shows the following result:

Call:
 randomForest(formula = CancerPosNeg ~ ., data = train_mydata,      ntree = 500, mtry = 2, importance = TRUE) 
               Type of random forest: classification
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 2

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 4.66%
Confusion matrix:
               CancerNegative CancerPositive class.error
CancerNegative            654              0           0
CancerPositive             32              0           1

I see a very good OOB error rate, which tells us that in roughly 95% of the cases the prediction was correct. 
However, I am confused with confusiton matrix result, showing 0 for cancer positive classificaiton in cancer positive cases (?)

Per the variable importance plot, the number of pregnancies would be the most error-prone variable, 
while 'Years of Hormonal Contraception' is the best to use for predictions in this project. 

PS:
Hope the interpretation of project results is correct. 
I don't have statistical background and it took a lot of additional efforts for me (lots of youtube tutorials) 
to learn things to be able to write this report :)
